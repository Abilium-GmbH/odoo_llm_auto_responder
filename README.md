# odoo_llm_auto_responder

LLM auto responder is a module for the enterprise-resource-planning (ERP) software [odoo](https://www.odoo.com).

This module allows you to generate llm supported automatic responses for odoo helpdesk tickets. Therefore it uses and is depending on the [Helpdesk Management](https://github.com/OCA/helpdesk/tree/16.0) module. 

It was developed by 6 Computer Science students at the university of Bern in cooperation with [Abilium](https://www.abilium.com/).

## Getting started

We developed the module for the community edition (version 16.0) of odoo. It should work just fine with the Enterprise Edition but wasn't tested by us.


To use this module you either have to clone our repository or if odoo is already installed, you have to copy both the folders 'helpdesk_mgmt'
and 'odoo_llm_auto_responder' into your addons folder. It is important that the folders are in the addons folder and not in a subfolder!

Now just open your odoo, go to the Apps Page and install the odoo_llm_auto_responder module. This will automatically install the helpdesk_mgmt module if it isn't already.
